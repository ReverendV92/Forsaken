# Forsaken

Source files to the cancelled Source mod 'Forsaken'

## Synopsis

Forsaken was intended to be a hybrid team deathmatch/RTS mod where three factions vying for control of food and supplies would battle.

An interesting concept that was left abandoned in 2006 until the release of the source files a few years later.

These are the source files as they were distrubuted, minus the batch files used to individually compile each and every model and texture.
Now that we have things like Crowbar and VTFEdit these files have outlived their usefulness and have been omitted.

# Original Mod Blurb from ModDB:

> Forsaken is set in the year 2009, 3 years after a genetically engineered virus escaped a secret government lab wiping out mankind in a matter of days.

> Out of the surviving human population 3 factions formed;

> The “Governors”, a band of ex-military soldiers lead by a fanatical General. A freak and ruthless “Religious Cult” that say the predicted this 'cleansing' all along, and the final faction are ordinary people, a handful of Civilians bewildered and angry at what happened to their families and everyone they knew.

> Forsaken is an urban warfare multi-player mod for Half-life 2, featuring various unique gameplay modes & scenarios and is the depiction of these three factions; and their struggle for power, territory and ultimately survival, within this dark new era of human existence.

> The objective-based team play is all about the control of territories (maps) and the resources in those territories. At the start of a "war" each faction has a certain amount of resources. They can capture more resources by raiding various capture points on a map.

> These resources consist of food and weapons supplies. Every round is a day in Forsaken and each day requires you eat and use up 1 food resource for each member in your faction. You capture more food supplies and steal from other factions in order to keep from starving to death!

> Hoarding weapon supplies allows you to save up for bigger guns, upgrades, and other special equipment. Weapon supplies are shared resources and you must work together as a faction to know when and where to use them most effectively.

> The winner of the "war" is the faction that controls all the territory on the server, or starves the other factions of their resources. All 3 factions play at once over a series of barren cityscapes, fighting for control of this post-apocalyptic world, and ultimately for their survival.
